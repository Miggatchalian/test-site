          <h2> Main Character </h2>
          <p>
            Harry James Potter is the titular character of the Harry Potter series of novels by J. K.
            Rowling.
            The plot of the seven-book series chronicles seven years in the life of the orphan Harry, who,
            on
            his eleventh birthday, learns he is a wizard. He attends Hogwarts, a school of magic, where he
            receives guidance from the headmaster Albus Dumbledore and becomes friends with Ron Weasley and
            Hermione Granger. Harry learns that during his infancy, the Dark wizard Lord Voldemort murdered
            his
            parents but was unable to kill him as well. The plot of the series revolves around Harry's
            struggle
            to adapt to the wizarding world and defeat Voldemort.

            Harry is regarded as a fictional icon and has been described by many critics, readers, and
            audiences
            as one of the greatest literary and film characters of all time. He is portrayed by Daniel
            Radcliffe
            in all eight Harry Potter films. Harry also appears in the play Harry Potter and the Cursed
            Child,
            which has been produced on stage since 2016. Potter is probably one of the bravest characters to
            ever exist in the history of children's literature. Despite being brought up in a non-magic
            family
            for a major period of his early life, Harry went on to defeat one of the strongest dark wizards
            to
            ever have lived.
